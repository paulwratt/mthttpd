       mthttpd - modern tiny/turbo/throttling HTTP server
           based on thttpd version 2.27 of 19Oct2015

mthttpd is a modern version of thttpd HTTP server. It will compile 
with gcc v4.9 or later, including gcc v6.1.0. It may compile with
other or older versions too.

mthttpd comes with a _php.cgi_ bounce script that allows any version 
of PHP to execute php scripts from withn ANY _thttpd_ based server. That 
script will work with the original _thttpd_ from Jef's acme.com site, 
as well as _shttpd_ on github.com, and with _paged_ on Xinix OS. It may 
also work with "premium thttpd" by Sascha Schumann (not tested). It may 
also with the PHP SAPI patched version 2.21b of thttpd (testing soon).

mthttpd has some minor changes including setting web server user group
to "www-data" by default, to simplify Apache migration.

To assist with PHP as an executable (.php registered with binfmt_misc)
and allow better web server development, mthttpd now outputs the PHP 
specific SCRIPT_FILENAME variable, and for PHP Apache compatability, the 
DOCUMENT_ROOT and REDIRECT_STATUS variables, directly from web server.

The _php.cgi_ script constructs these variables due to a quirk in the 
way CGI path overloading is done. However those variables will allow 
.php executables to be run directly using the "binfmt_misc" method.

Original README:

thttpd is a simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP server.

Simple: It handles only the minimum necessary to implement HTTP/1.1.

Small: See the size comparison chart at
http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/notes.html#sizes.  It also has a
very small run-time size, since it does not fork and is very careful about
memory allocation.

Portable: It compiles cleanly on FreeBSD 2.x/3.x, SunOS 4.1.x, Solaris 2.x,
BSD/OS 2.x, Linux 1.2.x, OSF/1 (on a 64-bit Alpha), and no doubt many others.

Fast: In typical use it's about as fast as the best full-featured servers
(Apache, NCSA, Netscape).  Under extreme load it's much faster.

Secure: It goes to great lengths to protect the web server machine
against attacks and breakins from other sites.

It also has one extremely useful feature (URL-traffic-based throttling) that
no other server currently has.
