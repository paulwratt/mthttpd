Here is what I used to start the local service for the XiniX GUI:

 paged -u root -p 8181 -c '**.sh' -h 127.0.0.1 -d /usr/local/www/web.de
-i /var/run/paged.local.pid -l /var/log/paged_local.log

Note the single quote, not double quotes are necessary around the
'**.sh' parameter so that the shell does not try to interpret the
wildcard characters.  Also if you are using an external IP address
(eg 192.168.1.100), you may want to use "-u nobody" instead, for
security.
